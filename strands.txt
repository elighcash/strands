STRANDS: To Read & Such

Everything within the blog or journal is organized in the tapestry. Instead of tags, there are strands, essentially topics. Each post, or knot, has two strands associated with it, one as the primary or A strand, and one as the secondary or B strand. The use of only two strands for each knot is intended to focus the topics of the content. Instead of creating a flood of tags, the writer must decide what the post is specifically about, within at most two categories. This forces constrained and concise writing.
