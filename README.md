STRANDS: To Read & Such
=======================

Intro
-----
STRANDS is a newborn content management system. It's focus is on an innovative way of organizing content, and to a lesser extent typography and layout. The development of the project is based around the website [Ends&Odds](http://endsandodds.net/), the initial motivation for the STRANDS project.

Use
---
The goal is to make a complete Django project for those who want "one-click" type installs, while still allowing for the core app to be plugged in somewhere else. (This will likely take advantage of [django-deploy](http://github.com/typeish/django-deploy) once that matures.)

For now, if you want to use this, you can download the project and get it set up, though don't expect to have an easy time of it (yet).
